                    View components are similar to partial views, but they're much more powerful. View components don't use
                    model binding, and only depend on the data provided when calling into it. This article was written using
                    controllers and views, but view components also work with Razor Pages.

                    A view component:
    
                <ul>
                    <li>Renders a chunk rather than a whole response.</li>
                    <li>Includes the same separation-of-concerns and testability benefits found between a controller and
                        view.</li>
                    <li>Can have parameters and business logic.</li>
                    <li>Is typically invoked from a layout page.</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
    
                <p>
                    View components are intended anywhere you have reusable rendering logic that's too complex for a partial
                    view, such as:
                <ul>
                    <li>Dynamic navigation menus</li>
                    <li>Tag cloud (where it queries the database)</li>
                    <li>Login panel</li>
                    <li>Shopping cart</li>
                    <li>Recently published articles</li>
                    <li>Sidebar content on a typical blog</li>
                    <li>A login panel that would be rendered on every page and show either the links to log out or log in,
                        depending on the log in state of the user</li>
                </ul>
    
                <p>
                    A view component consists of two parts: the class
                    (typically derived from <a
                        href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.mvc.viewcomponent">ViewComponent</a>)
                    and the result
                    it returns (typically a view).
                    Like controllers, a view component can be a POCO, but most developers will want to take advantage of the
                    methods and properties available by deriving from
                    <code>ViewComponent</code>.
    
                    When considering if view components meet an app's specifications, consider using Razor components
                    instead. Razor components also combine markup with C# code to produce reusable UI units. Razor
                    components are designed for developer productivity when providing client-side UI logic and composition.

                    A view component class can be created by any of the following:
                <ul>
                    <li>Deriving from <i>ViewComponent</i></li>
                    <li>Decorating a class with the <code>[ViewComponent]</code> attribute, or deriving from a class with
                        the <code>[ViewComponent]</code> attribute</li>
                    <li>Creating a class where the name ends with the suffix <i>ViewComponent</i></li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Like controllers, view components must be public, non-nested, and non-abstract classes.
                    The view component name is the class name with the "ViewComponent" suffix removed.
                    It can also be explicitly specified using the <code>ViewComponentAttribute.Name</code> property.

                        in a view component

                <p>
                    A view component defines its logic in an <code>InvokeAsync</code> method that returns a
                    <code>Task&lt;IViewComponentResult&gt;</code> or in a
                    synchronous <code>Invoke</code> method that returns an <code>IViewComponentResult</code>. Parameters
                    come directly from invocation of the view component,
                    not from model binding. A view component never directly handles a request. Typically, a view component
                    initializes a model and passes
                    it to a view by calling the <code>View</code> method. In summary, view component methods:
                <ul>
                    <li>Define an <code>InvokeAsync</code> method that returns a
                        <code>Task&lt;IViewComponentResult&gt;</code> or a synchronous <code>Invoke</code>
                        method that returns an <code>IViewComponentResult</code>.
                    </li>
                    <li>Typically initializes a model and passes it to a view by calling the <code>ViewComponent</code>
                        <code>View</code> method.
                    </li>
                    <li>Parameters come from the calling method, not HTTP. There's no model binding.</li>
                    <li>Are not reachable directly as an HTTP endpoint. They're invoked from your code (usually in a view).
                        A view component never handles a request.</li>
                    <li>Are overloaded on the signature rather than any details from the current HTTP request.</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
            </section>
    
            <section id="View_search_path" class="main-section">
                <header>View search path</header>
                <p>
                    The runtime searches for the view in the following paths:
                <ul>
                    <li>/Views/{Controller Name}/Components/{View Component Name}/{View Name}</li>
                    <li>/Views/Shared/Components/{View Component Name}/{View Name}</li>
                    <li>/Pages/Shared/Components/{View Component Name}/{View Name}</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The search path applies to projects using controllers + views and Razor Pages.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The default view name for a view component is Default, which means your view file will typically be
                    named
                    Default.cshtml.
                    You can specify a different view name when creating the view component result or when calling the
                    <code>View</code> method.
                    <br>
                    We recommend you name the view file Default.cshtml and use the
                    <br>
                    <i>Views/Shared/Components/{View Component Name}/{View Name}</i> path. The <code>PriorityList</code>
                    view
                    component used in this sample uses
                    <br>
                    <i>Views/Shared/Components/PriorityList/Default.cshtml</i> for the view component view.
